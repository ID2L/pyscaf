  ([`f7b2579`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/f7b257952ea9903defe7c1d45e7aa106790af66c))


## v0.5.0 (2025-05-27)

### Bug Fixes

- **preference_chain**: Enhance dependency loading and tree building with detailed comments
  ([`af0e597`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/af0e5970670d271a8f1edc3dcffa76e611dbdd9a))

Long description: - Improved the `load_and_complete_dependencies` function to provide clearer
  documentation on its behavior, specifically regarding the auto-completion of the 'after' property
  when only one dependency exists. - Added comprehensive comments throughout the
  `build_dependency_tree` and `DependencyTreeWalker` classes to clarify the purpose and
  functionality of each method and variable. - Enhanced the `print_tree` method to include visual
  cues for fulfilled and external dependencies, improving the usability of the dependency tree
  representation. - These changes aim to increase code readability and maintainability, making it
  easier for future developers to understand the logic behind dependency management and tree
  traversal.

### Code Style

- Added flake8 / blackformatter in local settings.json
  ([`af0e597`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/af0e5970670d271a8f1edc3dcffa76e611dbdd9a))

### Features

- Make best_execution_order robust to circular dependencies
  ([`af0e597`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/af0e5970670d271a8f1edc3dcffa76e611dbdd9a))

Long description: - The function now handles cycles or unsatisfiable dependencies gracefully by
  picking the first remaining node in a stable order (sorted by id) instead of raising an exception.
  - A warning is printed listing the nodes for which dependencies could not be satisfied. - This
  ensures a stable and always available execution order, even in the presence of preference cycles.

- **interactive**: Enhance project initialization with conditional questions
  ([`af0e597`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/af0e5970670d271a8f1edc3dcffa76e611dbdd9a))

Long description: - Removed the interactive mode logic from the `init` function and encapsulated it
  within the `ActionManager` class, specifically in the new `ask_interactive_questions` method. -
  Introduced a `condition_to_ask` method in the `Action` class to determine if a question should be
  asked based on the current context, allowing for more dynamic and context-aware interactions. -
  Added a new CLI option for enabling versioning with Git, enhancing the project's configurability
  during initialization. - The changes aim to streamline the user experience by only prompting for
  necessary information, thus improving the overall interactivity of the project setup process.

- **preference_chain**: Add __main__.py as package entry point
  ([`af0e597`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/af0e5970670d271a8f1edc3dcffa76e611dbdd9a))

Long description: - Created __main__.py in pyscaf.preference_chain to serve as the executable entry
  point for the package. - Moved the main execution logic (dependency loading and tree printing)
  from __init__.py to __main__.py. - This allows running `python -m pyscaf.preference_chain` as
  recommended by Python packaging best practices. - __init__.py now only handles package
  initialization and imports.

- **preference_chain**: Add recursive optimal dependency resolution order from root
  ([`af0e597`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/af0e5970670d271a8f1edc3dcffa76e611dbdd9a))

Long description: - Introduces a recursive function to compute the optimal order of dependency
  resolution starting from a given root node. - At each recursion level, direct dependants are
  ordered using best_execution_order, and the process is applied recursively to each dependant. -
  The root id is always included as the first element in the returned order, ensuring the full
  resolution path is explicit and starts from the root. - This approach minimizes context switching
  and follows the 'after' preferences as much as possible, providing a stable and logical
  question/step ordering for complex dependency graphs. - The final optimal order is printed for
  user inspection.

### Refactoring

- Action now declare their dependencies on themselves
  ([`af0e597`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/af0e5970670d271a8f1edc3dcffa76e611dbdd9a))

* [refactor] actions to be in declarative mod

This commit introduces configuration for the 'develop' branch in the semantic release setup. The
  'develop' branch is now recognized as a pre-release branch with a specific token for release
  candidates. Additionally, the GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to trigger releases on
  pushes to the 'develop' branch, enhancing the CI/CD pipeline for development workflows.
