### Features

- Update dependencies and project structure ([#2](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/pull/2),
  [`462e0e0`](https://github.com/ID2L/pyscaf/commit/462e0e0f1f7a9b1520e4473e08af26ad308ac16f))

This commit enhances the project by updating the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files to include
  new development dependencies such as `python-semantic-release` and `python-dotenv`. It also
  introduces a new script for publishing, improving the project's deployment capabilities. The
  `poetry.lock` file has been modified to include additional packages like `certifi`,
  `charset-normalizer`, and `click-option-group`, among others, which are essential for development
  and testing.

Furthermore, the project structure has been refined to include the `scripts` directory, allowing for
  better organization of utility scripts. The `dev` group in the `pyproject.toml` has been expanded
  to support a broader range of development tools, ensuring a more robust development environment.

These changes aim to streamline the development process and enhance the overall functionality of the
  project.
